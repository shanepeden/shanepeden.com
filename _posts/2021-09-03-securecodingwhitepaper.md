Security within the supply chain has become a hot topic, especially in the wake of the [SolarWinds supply chain attacks](https://thehackernews.com/2020/12/new-evidence-suggests-solarwinds.html), but what is the best way for software publishers to prevent vulnerabilities in their codebase. With so many opinions and options available, it can be difficult to choose security controls that do not also impede the engineering process.

But what if teams could integrate security without slowing down development?

In this whitepaper, I will walk you through the entire DevOps lifecycle and explore ideas for achieving frictionless integration of security into the existing DevOps lifecycle. At each phase, security integrations are identified for teams to consider implementing to fuse security and the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).

Every integration should reinforce the technical, cultural, and business benefits of DevOps while ensuring adequate security is integrated without handicapping product delivery.
