I worked as a consultant for 10 years, starting with IT implementations, and eventually shifting into IT Audit, then cybersecurity. Over this time, I had the opportunity to engage with over 120 companies and work intimately with about 25.

With those 25 or so companies I had an opportunity to partner with on program development and other strategic initiatives, I have learned a great deal about how technology companies both succeed and fail. After my long marathon as a consultant, I transitioned full-time into running the information security and compliance program at Patientco, which was by far my favorite client of all time as a consultant.

Getting to work for Patientco was a dream come true. No company is perfect, but to me, this team had some of the highest caliber leadership and talent I have ever experienced out of the 120+ companies I have crossed paths with over the years.

After spending three years as a consultant and nearly one year as a full-time employee with Patientco, leading their security and compliance program, we hit it big and was acquired by Waystar. I am so fortunate to have had the opportunity to be part of their start-up journey!

## Grabbing a Seat at the Product Team Round Table

Once I slotted into a full-time role at Patientco, leadership started leaning on me to solve much bigger problems than I was ever tasked with as a consultant. Our Information Risk Team had high expectations for my business function.

Initially, I figured this would be a piece of cake. I’d manage the risk initiatives like I always had in the past, by drafting a plan of action, finding champions in the business to help me drive the initiative, and seeing it through. But there was a key difference between these challenges and the ones I was used to dealing with as a consultant. There was no audit or certification on the line and most of the problems I faced required getting the support of Engineering and DevOps to fix!

If you’ve ever worked with software engineers before, you know they can be a little like cats (or honey badgers).

I eventually learned the path to success was through the Product Management team. If I was to get anything done, I needed to get my initiatives prioritized by product, and represented in the engineering team’s backlogs and Kanban boards.  

## A Logical Evolution from Security and Compliance to the Product World

That decision to start inviting myself to the Product team meetings spurred a change of gears and perspective for me. I learned that the Product team’s approach to helping drive the direction of the product was not dissimilar to how I naturally operated as a consultant.
