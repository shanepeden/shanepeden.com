For many healthcare IT startups, the complexities of security, privacy, and compliance present a blind spot that can be difficult to address. Resources are tight and the stakes are high. Regulatory mandates and customer requirements can be a barrier to client acquisition and present significant risk. The organization is tasked with not only having to prove their product solves an important problem but also demonstrate to prospects that buying the product or services will not pose a security threat to their organization.

In this whitepaper, I present a security, privacy, and compliance roadmap for the healthcare IT startup to consider throughout the early stages of the organization's lifecycle. I also discuss some strategies for arming your sales teams with the information and tools they need to remove doubt in the mind of prospective healthcare customers.
