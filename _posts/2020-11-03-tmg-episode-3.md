## Podcast Summary

In this episode of the Tuesday Morning Grind we talk about the importance of tooling and how it impacts company culture, but also security.  Identifying not only tools that people like to use, but tools that are effective, go a long way in getting the team rowing in the same direction.

Listen in for our off the cuff thoughts and experiences.
